To install Cuttlefish on Debian, you need to download, build, and install the host Debian packages, then download and install the Android Cuttlefish virtual device (CVD) and its corresponding system image. Cuttlefish is a virtual Android device, and its host packages contain the necessary binaries and scripts to set it up and run it. 
Here's a step-by-step guide:
# Prepare your Debian environment:
Ensure virtualization with KVM is available. 
Check for KVM support by running
```sh
grep -c -w "vmx\\|svm" /proc/cpuinfo
```
A non-zero value indicates support. 
If running on a cloud machine, follow cloud-vendor-specific steps to enable virtualization. 
Update and upgrade your packages:
```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
Install required packages: 
```sh
sudo apt install -y git devscripts config-package-dev debhelper-compat golang curl
```
# Download and build the host packages:
Clone the Cuttlefish repository: 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/google/android-cuttlefish
```
Navigate to the repository: 
```sh
cd android-cuttlefish
```
Build the packages using the provided script: 
```sh
tools/buildutils/build_packages.sh
```
# Install the host packages:
Install the base package:
```sh
sudo dpkg -i ./cuttlefish-base_*_*64.deb || sudo apt-get install -f
```
Install the user package:
```sh
sudo dpkg -i ./cuttlefish-user_*_*64.deb || sudo apt-get install -f
```
Add your user to necessary groups:
```sh
sudo usermod -aG kvm,cvdnetwork,render $USER
```
Reboot to apply changes:
```sh
sudo reboot
```
# Download and install the CVD and system image:
Navigate to the Android Continuous Integration site http://ci.android.com.
Choose a branch (e.g., aosp-android-latest-release or aosp-android13-gsi). 
Select a build target (e.g., aosp_cf_x86_64_only_phone-userdebug for x86_64 or aosp_cf_arm64_only_phone-userdebug for ARM64). 
Download the corresponding OTA image (system image) and host package. 
Combine the packages: 
```sh
mkdir cf && cd cf && tar xvf /path/to/cvd-host_package.tar.gz && unzip /path/to/aosp_cf_x86_64_phone-img-xxxxxx.zip
```
# Launch Cuttlefish:
Launch the virtual device: 
```sh
HOME=$PWD ./bin/launch_cvd
```
You can add options like -daemon for background mode, -memory_mb, -data_policy, -blank_data_image_mb, and -cpus to customize the launch. 
Connect to the device using adb:
```sh
HOME=${PWD} ./bin/adb root
```
# Stop Cuttlefish:
```sh
HOME=$PWD ./bin/stop_cvd
```
